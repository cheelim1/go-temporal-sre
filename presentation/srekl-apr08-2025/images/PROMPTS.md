# Image Generation Prompts for Temporal Idempotency Presentation

Use these prompts with DALL-E or ChatGPT's image generation to create visual aids for your presentation.

## double-billing.png

**Prompt:**

"A split-screen technical illustration showing a payment system failure scenario. On the left side, show a customer's account being charged twice for the same transaction. On the right side, show a stressed SRE engineer looking at error logs and multiple transaction records with identical IDs. Use a red color scheme to highlight the problem area, and include visual elements like duplicate transaction IDs, timestamps showing similar times, and a declining account balance. Style should be clean, professional, and suitable for a technical presentation."


## non-idempotent-script.png

**Prompt:**
"A technical illustration showing the dangers of non-idempotent scripts in a payment processing system. Show multiple instances of the same bash script running simultaneously, each processing the same payment. Include visual elements like duplicate transaction records, a customer account being charged multiple times, and error logs. Use a red color scheme to highlight the problem areas. The style should be clean, professional infographic style with icons representing scripts, databases, and payment systems. Add small terminal windows showing script execution with timestamps that are very close to each other."

## idempotency-concept.png

**Prompt:**
"A clean, technical infographic explaining the concept of idempotency. On the left side, show a non-idempotent operation with multiple executions leading to multiple different states (illustrated by different colored boxes). On the right side, show an idempotent operation with multiple executions all resulting in the same final state (illustrated by identical colored boxes). Use arrows to show the flow of operations and include mathematical notation f(f(x)) = f(x) somewhere in the image. Use a blue and green color scheme with clean lines and a minimalist style suitable for a technical SRE presentation."

## temporal-logo.png

**Prompt:**
"The official Temporal logo on a clean background. The logo features a stylized infinity symbol in blue-green gradient colors. The image should be crisp, professional, and suitable for a technical presentation with ample whitespace around the logo."

*Note: Instead of generating this, you may want to download the official logo from [Temporal's website](https://temporal.io/media-kit) for proper branding.*

## superscript-architecture.png

**Prompt:**
"A technical architecture diagram showing how SuperScript wraps non-idempotent bash scripts in Temporal workflows. The diagram should include: an HTTP API layer receiving requests, a Temporal server handling workflow orchestration, workflow workers executing the workflows, and activities that wrap bash scripts. Use a flow diagram style with boxes for components and arrows showing the request flow. Include a client making multiple identical requests that get deduplicated. Use a professional blue and green color scheme with clean lines and minimal technical style. Add small icons representing each component (API, Temporal, scripts, etc.)."

## workflow-deduplication.png

**Prompt:**
"A technical diagram illustrating Temporal's workflow deduplication mechanism. Show multiple client requests (at least 5) with the same WorkflowID all being routed to a single workflow execution. Use a funnel or filter visual metaphor where multiple incoming arrows with the same ID converge to a single execution path. Include visual elements like workflow IDs, RunIDs, and activity execution. Use blue and green colors to represent successful deduplication, with clean lines and a minimal technical style suitable for SRE engineers. Add small computer/server icons to represent clients and the Temporal server."

## idempotency-proof.png

**Prompt:**
"A technical screenshot mockup showing terminal output from a Temporal idempotency test. The image should show five different clients attempting to start workflows with the same ID, and all receiving the same RunID. Important lines should be highlighted in green, especially where it shows '5 clients received workflow handles' and 'Activity execution count: 1'. The terminal should have a dark background with green and white text, styled like a typical command line interface. Include visual indicators like checkmarks or success icons next to the key proof points."

## sre-visibility.png

**Prompt:**
"A dashboard-style visualization showing Temporal's execution visibility features that benefit SREs. Include panels showing: workflow execution history with timestamps, activity retry statistics, workflow search interface, and system health metrics. Use a dark theme with blue and green highlights for important data points. The style should be clean and professional, resembling modern observability tools like Grafana or Datadog. Include small graphs, timelines, and status indicators that would appeal to SRE engineers."

## questions.png

**Prompt:**
"A friendly, engaging illustration representing a Q&A session about Temporal and idempotency. Show a stylized character (representing a presenter) next to thought bubbles or question marks in different sizes. Include visual elements related to the presentation topic like workflow symbols, idempotency concepts, and Temporal's logo subtly in the background. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with blues and greens. The image should be clean, slightly playful but still appropriate for a technical presentation to SRE engineers."

## Additional Tips

1. **Consistency**: Request that all images maintain a consistent color scheme (blues and greens matching Temporal's branding) for a cohesive presentation.

2. **Style**: Specify "technical illustration style" or "clean infographic style" to ensure the images are appropriate for an SRE audience.

3. **Text**: If you want text embedded in the images, explicitly mention it in the prompt. Otherwise, you can add text directly in your presentation software.

4. **Iterations**: Don't hesitate to refine prompts based on initial results. Often the second or third attempt with adjustments yields better results.

5. **Export Size**: Request larger resolution images (1024Ã—1024 or higher) to ensure they look crisp when displayed during your presentation.
