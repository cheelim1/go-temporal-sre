# Go Temporal SRE - Batch Processing Implementation

## Current Implementation Status

We've implemented a demonstration of non-idempotent transaction processing to illustrate potential issues in distributed systems. This serves as the foundation for implementing idempotent solutions with Temporal.

### Implemented Components

1. **Account Management System**:
   - `Account` struct holding account ID and balance
   - Thread-safe `AccountStore` with mutex synchronization for concurrent access
   - Methods for account creation and retrieval with proper lock boundaries

2. **Fee Deduction Logic**:
   - `DeductFee` method on `AccountStore` that demonstrates non-idempotent behavior
   - Random delay (200ms-2s) to simulate network/processing latency
   - Thread-safe implementation verified with Go's race detector

3. **HTTP Interface**:
   - `DeductFeeHTTPHandler` for exposing functionality via REST endpoint
   - JSON request/response with proper validation and error handling
   - Path-based order ID extraction with body-based account ID and amount
   - Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Test Suite**:
   - `TestNonIdempotency` demonstrating the double-deduction problem
   - Two calls with same order ID resulting in double fee deduction
   - Race-condition-free testing with proper synchronization

## Go Idioms and Best Practices

### Current Implementation

1. **Clean Package Structure**:
   - Package `batch` follows standard Go project layout (`internal/` for private code)
   - One package per directory with clear responsibility
   - Clear separation between data models, business logic, and HTTP handlers

2. **Testability**:
   - Methods designed for testability (dependency injection of store)
   - HTTP handlers separated from business logic
   - Used `httptest` package for HTTP testing without external dependencies
   - Test cases that verify both functionality and thread safety

3. **Type System**:
   - Strong typing with custom structs for domain entities (Account)
   - JSON struct tags for serialization/deserialization
   - Request/response types with proper validation
   - Error handling following Go conventions (explicit error returns)

4. **Concurrency Safety**:
   - Proper mutex synchronization for shared state
   - Clear lock boundaries to prevent race conditions
   - Methods on types that own the data they operate on
   - Race detector verification in tests

5. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API with proper HTTP methods
   - JSON request/response with consistent structure
   - Input validation with descriptive error messages
   - Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

### For Future Enhancements

1. **Use Go 1.24 Features**:
   - Range over func values (introduced in Go 1.22+)
   - Any new features specific to Go 1.24
   - Utilize new standard library improvements

2. **Advanced Error Handling**:
   - Implement domain-specific error types for better error handling
   - Consider using the `errors` package for error wrapping and inspection
   - Add structured logging for better debugging

3. **Enhanced Concurrency Patterns**:
   - Consider using more fine-grained locking (per-account locks)
   - Explore lock-free data structures for higher performance
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Connection pooling for database operations
   - Caching frequently accessed data
   - Profiling and benchmarking critical paths

5. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Input sanitization and validation
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting and protection against abuse

## Temporal Integration Guidelines

### For Future Implementation

1. **Workflow Structure**:
   - Separate activities from workflows
   - Keep activities pure and idempotent
   - Use workflow ID for deduplication

2. **Activity Design**:
   - Create self-contained, reusable activities
   - Use activity options (StartToCloseTimeout, RetryPolicy)
   - Consider using activity heartbeating for long-running operations

3. **Idempotency Implementation**:
   - Use idempotency keys (order ID) to prevent duplicate processing
   - Implement a transaction log or state tracking
   - Consider implementing compensation logic for rollbacks

4. **Testing Temporal Code**:
   - Use Temporal's test framework for testing workflows
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test happy path and failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual functions and methods
   - Use table-driven tests for different scenarios
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between components
   - Use `httptest` for HTTP handlers
   - Consider using testcontainers for database dependencies

3. **Temporal-Specific Tests**:
   - Use Temporal's test suite for workflow testing
   - Test workflow replay logic
   - Test activity execution and retry behavior

## Next Steps

1. Implement an idempotent version of the fee deduction process using Temporal
   - Use workflow ID and run ID for deduplication
   - Implement transaction logs to track processed orders

2. Create workflow definitions and activity implementations
   - Define clear workflow interfaces
   - Implement reusable activities with proper error handling
   - Set up appropriate timeouts and retry policies

3. Enhance error handling and observability
   - Implement structured logging
   - Add metrics for key operations
   - Set up distributed tracing

4. Add comprehensive testing
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for workflows and activities
   - Load and performance testing

5. Implement database persistence
   - Replace in-memory store with a proper database
   - Implement database transactions for atomicity
   - Add data migration capabilities

## Important Design Considerations

1. **Idempotency**: Ensure operations can be retried without side effects
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Handle various failure scenarios gracefully
3. **Observability**: Add proper logging, metrics, and tracing
4. **Performance**: Consider throughput and latency requirements
5. **Security**: Protect sensitive data and operations

## Recent Improvements

1. **Thread Safety**:
   - Refactored `AccountStore` to use proper mutex synchronization
   - Eliminated race conditions verified with Go's race detector
   - Implemented proper lock boundaries for all shared state operations

2. **API Enhancements**:
   - Converted `DeductFee` from a standalone function to a method on `AccountStore`
   - Implemented JSON request/response handling
   - Added proper input validation for all user-provided data
   - Created structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Eliminated unnecessary defensive copying for better performance
   - Improved error handling with helper functions
   - Enhanced test cases to verify both functionality and thread safety
   - Added proper response parsing in tests
