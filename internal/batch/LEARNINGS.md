# Go Temporal SRE - Batch Processing Implementation

## Current Implementation Status

We've implemented a demonstration of non-idempotent transaction processing to illustrate potential issues in distributed systems. This serves as the foundation for implementing idempotent solutions with Temporal.

### Implemented Components

1. **Account Management System**:
   - `Account` struct holding account ID and balance
   - `AccountStore` for in-memory account storage and operations

2. **Fee Deduction Logic**:
   - `DeductFee` function that demonstrates non-idempotent behavior
   - Random delay (200ms-2s) to simulate network/processing latency

3. **HTTP Interface**:
   - `DeductFeeHTTPHandler` for exposing functionality via REST endpoint
   - Path-based order ID extraction

4. **Test Suite**:
   - `TestNonIdempotency` demonstrating the double-deduction problem
   - Two calls with same order ID resulting in double fee deduction

## Go Idioms and Best Practices

### Current Implementation

1. **Clean Package Structure**:
   - Package `batch` follows standard Go project layout (`internal/` for private code)
   - One package per directory with clear responsibility

2. **Testability**:
   - Functions designed for testability (dependency injection of store)
   - HTTP handlers separated from business logic
   - Used `httptest` package for HTTP testing without external dependencies

3. **Type System**:
   - Strong typing with custom structs for domain entities (Account)
   - Error handling following Go conventions (explicit error returns)

### For Future Enhancements

1. **Use Go 1.24 Features**:
   - Range over func values (introduced in Go 1.22+)
   - Any new features specific to Go 1.24

2. **Idiomatic Error Handling**:
   - Return errors, don't panic
   - Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("... %w", err)`
   - Consider domain-specific error types for better error handling

3. **Concurrency Patterns**:
   - Use channels for communication between goroutines
   - Consider sync.WaitGroup for coordinating multiple goroutines
   - Apply mutexes when needed for shared state

## Temporal Integration Guidelines

### For Future Implementation

1. **Workflow Structure**:
   - Separate activities from workflows
   - Keep activities pure and idempotent
   - Use workflow ID for deduplication

2. **Activity Design**:
   - Create self-contained, reusable activities
   - Use activity options (StartToCloseTimeout, RetryPolicy)
   - Consider using activity heartbeating for long-running operations

3. **Idempotency Implementation**:
   - Use idempotency keys (order ID) to prevent duplicate processing
   - Implement a transaction log or state tracking
   - Consider implementing compensation logic for rollbacks

4. **Testing Temporal Code**:
   - Use Temporal's test framework for testing workflows
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test happy path and failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual functions and methods
   - Use table-driven tests for different scenarios
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between components
   - Use `httptest` for HTTP handlers
   - Consider using testcontainers for database dependencies

3. **Temporal-Specific Tests**:
   - Use Temporal's test suite for workflow testing
   - Test workflow replay logic
   - Test activity execution and retry behavior

## Next Steps

1. Implement an idempotent version of the fee deduction process using Temporal
2. Create workflow definitions and activity implementations
3. Implement proper error handling and retry logic
4. Add comprehensive testing with Temporal's test framework
5. Consider adding observability tools (metrics, logging, tracing)

## Important Design Considerations

1. **Idempotency**: Ensure operations can be retried without side effects
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Handle various failure scenarios gracefully
3. **Observability**: Add proper logging, metrics, and tracing
4. **Performance**: Consider throughput and latency requirements
5. **Security**: Protect sensitive data and operations

This document will be updated as the implementation progresses.
