# Go Temporal SRE - Batch Processing Implementation

## Current Implementation Status

We've implemented a demonstration of non-idempotent transaction processing to illustrate potential issues in distributed systems. This serves as the foundation for implementing idempotent solutions with Temporal.

### Implemented Components

1. **Account Management System**:
   - `Account` struct holding account ID and balance
   - Thread-safe `AccountStore` with mutex synchronization for concurrent access
   - Methods for account creation and retrieval with proper lock boundaries

2. **Fee Deduction Logic**:
   - `DeductFee` method on `AccountStore` that demonstrates non-idempotent behavior
   - Random delay (200ms-2s) to simulate network/processing latency
   - Thread-safe implementation verified with Go's race detector

3. **HTTP Interface**:
   - `DeductFeeHTTPHandler` for exposing functionality via REST endpoint
   - JSON request/response with proper validation and error handling
   - Path-based order ID extraction with body-based account ID and amount
   - Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Test Suite**:
   - `TestNonIdempotency` demonstrating the double-deduction problem
   - Two calls with same order ID resulting in double fee deduction
   - Race-condition-free testing with proper synchronization

## Go Idioms and Best Practices

### Current Implementation

1. **Clean Package Structure**:
   - Package `batch` follows standard Go project layout (`internal/` for private code)
   - One package per directory with clear responsibility
   - Clear separation between data models, business logic, and HTTP handlers

2. **Testability**:
   - Methods designed for testability (dependency injection of store)
   - HTTP handlers separated from business logic
   - Used `httptest` package for HTTP testing without external dependencies
   - Test cases that verify both functionality and thread safety

3. **Type System**:
   - Strong typing with custom structs for domain entities (Account)
   - JSON struct tags for serialization/deserialization
   - Request/response types with proper validation
   - Error handling following Go conventions (explicit error returns)

4. **Concurrency Safety**:
   - Proper mutex synchronization for shared state
   - Clear lock boundaries to prevent race conditions
   - Methods on types that own the data they operate on
   - Race detector verification in tests

5. **API Design**:
   - RESTful API with proper HTTP methods
   - JSON request/response with consistent structure
   - Input validation with descriptive error messages
   - Proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios

## Implemented Temporal Workflow Idempotency

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Real Temporal Server Approach**:
   - We implemented idempotency testing using a real Temporal server (`testsuite.StartDevServer`) instead of the mocked test environment
   - This approach demonstrates actual Temporal behavior rather than simulating it with mocks
   - Using a real server validates that Temporal's guarantees work as expected in production scenarios

2. **Idempotency Mechanism**:
   - Implemented workflow idempotency using `WorkflowIDReusePolicy.REJECT_DUPLICATE`
   - This configuration ensures that Temporal rejects attempts to start a workflow with a WorkflowID that already exists
   - When multiple clients start a workflow with the same ID, they all receive workflow handles with the same RunID
   - This shared RunID is proof that Temporal's idempotency is working correctly

3. **Concurrent Workflow Execution**:
   - Implemented a test with 5 concurrent clients attempting to start workflows with the same WorkflowID
   - Used a barrier pattern to ensure truly concurrent execution attempts
   - All clients successfully received workflow handles but with identical RunIDs
   - The activity was executed exactly once despite multiple clients attempting execution

4. **Validation Approach**:
   - Verified idempotency by checking that:
     - All clients received the same RunID
     - The singleton account was modified exactly once
     - The activity execution count was exactly 1
     - All clients could retrieve the identical workflow result
   - Used green-colored terminal output to highlight the critical proof of idempotency

### Important Temporal Idempotency Behaviors

1. **RunID Significance**:
   - When multiple clients attempt to start a workflow with the same WorkflowID, Temporal returns handles with the same RunID
   - The identical RunID across clients confirms they're all accessing the same workflow execution
   - This is different from the test environment where we had to manually mock this behavior

2. **Activity Execution Guarantees**:
   - With proper workflow ID reuse policy, activities within a workflow are guaranteed to execute exactly once
   - This prevents issues like double charging or duplicate inventory changes
   - All clients can retrieve the result once the workflow completes

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Clients that attempt to start a workflow with an existing ID receive `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted` errors
   - These errors can be caught and handled appropriately in production code
   - The client can then use the existing workflow ID to get the result

4. **Benefits Over HTTP Implementation**:
   - The Temporal implementation solves the non-idempotent behavior seen in the HTTP implementation
   - It prevents double fee deductions in high-concurrency scenarios without complex application logic
   - The idempotency guarantee is provided by Temporal's infrastructure

## Temporal Integration Guidelines

### Best Practices Based on Implementation

1. **Workflow Structure**:
   - Separate activities from workflows for better testability and reuse
   - Keep workflow functions focused on orchestration logic
   - Use consistent workflow ID patterns that incorporate business identifiers (e.g., `"FEE-WF-" + orderID`)
   - Set appropriate workflow timeouts based on expected execution time

2. **Activity Design**:
   - Create self-contained, reusable activities with clear input/output contracts
   - Use activity options (StartToCloseTimeout, RetryPolicy) for reliability
   - Consider adding small deliberate delays in activities when testing concurrency
   - Return structured results that include operation status and relevant data

3. **Idempotency Implementation**:
   - Use `WorkflowIDReusePolicy.REJECT_DUPLICATE` to ensure idempotent execution
   - Design workflows to be naturally idempotent by using order IDs or transaction IDs as WorkflowIDs
   - Handle `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted` errors gracefully in client code
   - For business operations, verify results using the workflow ID even after errors

4. **Testing Temporal Code**:
   - Use `testsuite.StartDevServer` for testing with a real Temporal server
   - Create unique task queues for each test using UUID to avoid conflicts
   - Implement concurrent client tests to verify idempotency behavior
   - Use barriers or other synchronization primitives to create realistic concurrency scenarios

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test individual functions and methods
   - Use table-driven tests for different scenarios
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test interaction between components
   - Use `httptest` for HTTP handlers
   - Consider using testcontainers for database dependencies

3. **Temporal-Specific Tests**:
   - Use Temporal's test suite for workflow testing
   - Test workflow replay logic
   - Test activity execution and retry behavior

## Implementation Learnings and Design Considerations

### Key Technical Insights

1. **Temporal RunID Behavior**:
   - All clients attempting to start a workflow with the same WorkflowID receive handles with the same RunID
   - This is fundamental to Temporal's idempotency guarantee and differs from our initial understanding
   - Checking for identical RunIDs across clients is a reliable way to verify idempotency

2. **Real vs. Test Environment**:
   - Using a real Temporal server (`testsuite.StartDevServer`) provides more accurate behavior than mocked tests
   - Real server tests avoid false failures related to activity re-execution
   - The test environment required complex mocking that didn't accurately reflect production behavior

3. **Concurrency Testing**:
   - Implementing a barrier pattern ensured truly concurrent execution attempts
   - Each client got its own goroutine and waited at the barrier before execution
   - This approach created reliable race conditions to test idempotency guarantees

4. **Error Handling Nuances**:
   - The expected error (`WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted`) has specific semantics
   - Clients should be designed to handle this error by retrieving the result using the WorkflowID
   - Error handling can be simplified by focusing on the specific error type rather than string matching

5. **Workflow ID Design**:
   - Using business identifiers (order ID) as part of the Workflow ID creates natural idempotency
   - Structured IDs like `"FEE-WF-" + orderID` make workflows easily identifiable
   - For production systems, consider adding tenant or shard identifiers for multi-tenant systems

6. **Activity Execution Guarantees**:
   - With proper configuration, Temporal guarantees activities execute exactly once per workflow
   - This removes the need for application-level idempotency checks
   - The activity execution count should always be 1 despite multiple client attempts

7. **Temporal vs. HTTP Implementation**:
   - Temporal provides idempotency without complex application logic
   - The HTTP approach required explicit transaction logs or locking
   - Temporal's infrastructure-level guarantees are more robust against edge cases

1. **Idempotency**: Ensure operations can be retried without side effects
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Handle various failure scenarios gracefully
3. **Observability**: Add proper logging, metrics, and tracing
4. **Performance**: Consider throughput and latency requirements
5. **Security**: Protect sensitive data and operations
